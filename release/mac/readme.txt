The binaries in the /bin directory are not signed so your OS will probably complain. To avoid that, the first time you run each of them you should run them by right-clicking and selecting "Open" instead of double-clicking. Then you will be prompted to confirm that you want to run them. After that, you can run them normally. Additionally, to run the MuJoCo training you should also do the right-click and run thing for the mujoco dylib in /lib.
